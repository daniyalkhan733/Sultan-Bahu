Sultan Bahu Center Project Details                         </h3>
                <p>
                  Over the years, the center underwent several renovations to better serve the community. Initial renovations took place in 2009/2010, aimed at accommodating the needs of the local populace. However, it became apparent that more extensive renovations were necessary to fully realize the vision of the Sultan Bahu Centre and increasing demand of the Muslim Community. 
                  In 2018, the college was closed down, and the entire building was repurposed to serve as a Madressah and Masjid, and community centre, reflecting the evolving priorities of the trust and the community it serves. 
                  <br><br>
                  Despite facing challenges for planning permission the management of the Sultan Bahu Centre remained committed. The planning permission has now been granted and in the last year we raised just over £100,000 but actually a sum of £250,000 is required to complete one part of the project, which is starting in this holy month of Ramadhan. You are requested to please donate generously enabling us to complete the first phase of the new upcoming purpose built Mosque, Madrassah and community centre to cater the needs of Local communities.
                  <br><br>
                  The journey of Sultan Bahu Centre, formerly known as Alliance House / National Printing Press, has seen a significant transformation over the years. Originally established for different purposes, the building found its new identity when it was purchased by Hazrat Sultan Bahu Trust, UK in 2005. 
                  <br><br>

In 2006, the trust initiated the establishment of a female college on the first floor of the building, marking the beginning of its engagement with educational endeavors. However, recognizing the growing needs of the local community, the trust embarked on a new project in 2008 the Sultan Bahu Centre, located on the ground floor of the building.
